# Frontend

This is the frontend for the project.

## ReactJS

## Creating the application
We use this create-react-app to create a react application
```bash
sudo create-react-app twitter-react-app
```

## Starting the react application
We'll start our react application using npm start command
```bash
sudo npm start 
```


## Docker

### `Build docker file`

Building and compiling the docker file

```bash
docker build -t frontend-react-app . 
```

### `Run the docker image`
Here we want to run our docker container to start the flask app

```bash
sudo docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -d frontend-react-app
```

### `Checking if the docker file is running`
To verify the docker container is running properly we use the command
```bash
docker ps
```
Which will show the following result
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
